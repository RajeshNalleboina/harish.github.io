    <p>
      The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) under the new leadership envisions making the city of Hyderabad
      a world-class and Livable city on a mission mode. GHMC has made significant progress to enhance door-to-door
      collection, transportation and treatment of municipal solid waste as part of its “Saaf Hyderabad -Shaandar
      Hyderabad” initiative. However, waste segregation, the prevalence of garbage vulnerable points and behaviour
      change among citizens continue to be the main points for GHMC. Citizen participation with regards to segregation
      of waste, not littering and proper usage of public toilet facilities is imperative for enhancing and maintaining
      sanitation in the city
    </p>

      sanitation in general and Municipal solid waste management in Gajularamaram Circle 26 of Kukatpally Zone,
