    <h2>Our Founding History</h2>
    <p>
      Jagruthi Rural Development Society (JRDS) was registered in 2000 as a non-profit voluntary service society at
      Mahammadabad in Ranga Reddy district,
      Telangana, South India. JRDS was a need-based awakening by a group of like-minded social working youngsters to
      help the needy in times of urgency.
      Mahammadabad and nearby areas’ socio-economic and educational conditions were so backward and had never
      experienced voluntary service or any of such
      development facilitating support as of the other places in the district or the then State. Seeing the much
      rearward conditions of the people and the areas,
      we thought and decided to support the people and the areas through a process of participatory aspects – JRDS and
      rural people’s-collective works for their development.
      JRDS is working for the poorest of the poor and the protection of wildlife and conservation of forest resources
      and environment. The RDS has been working in the field of health,
      agriculture, women's development, environment, child welfare, rural infrastructure, rural skills up-gradation,
      education, income generation, child labour elimination etc.

      Thus since inception focusing on rural issues conducting studies and finding condign solutions to address them,
      JRDS, and facilitating development opportunities holistically and sustainably. Thus JRDS has a mission, which is
      to capacitate and facilitate the rural people of all categories to have actions among themselves for their
      development and to protect the environment that the JRDS never kept away and forgotten throughout these all years
      of its struggle for rural people’s development. That’s the guiding principle and motivating factor for JRDS to go
      forward even in its financial constraints to free the rural people from their bondage of ignorance, inability and
      misfortunes.
