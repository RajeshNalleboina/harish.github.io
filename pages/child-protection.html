    <h2 class="mt-4 child-head">Child Protection:</h2>
    <p class="child-para">
      Children experience insidious forms of violence, exploitation and abuse. It happens in every country, and in the
      places children should be most protected – their homes, schools and online. Violence against children can be
      physical, emotional or sexual. And in many cases, children suffer at the hands of the people they trust.<br />
      Children in humanitarian settings are especially vulnerable. During armed conflict, natural disasters and other
      emergencies, children may be forced to flee their homes, some torn from their families and exposed to exploitation
      and abuse along the way. They risk injury and death. They may be recruited by armed forces. Especially for girls
      and women, the threat of gender-based violence soars.<br />
      Harmful cultural practices pose another grave risk in various parts of the world. Hundreds of millions of girls
      have been subjected to child marriage and female genital mutilation – even though both are internationally
      recognized human rights violations.
      <br />No matter the circumstance, every child has the right to be protected from violence, exploitation and abuse.
      Child protection systems connect children to vital social services and fair justice systems – starting at birth.
      They provide care to the most vulnerable, including children uprooted by conflict, poverty and disaster; victims
      of child labour or trafficking; and those who live with disabilities or in alternative care. Above all, protecting
      children means protecting their physical, mental and psychosocial needs to safeguard their futures.

    <h1 class="child-head">Child Labour:</h1>
    <p class="child-para">Economic hardship exacts a toll on millions of families worldwide – and in some places, it
      comes at the price of a child’s physical safety. Nearly 1 in 10 children across the globe are subjected to child
      labour, almost half of whom are in hazardous forms of work.</p>
    <h1 class="child-head">Child Marraige:</h1>
    <p class="child-para">Child marriage robs girls of their childhood and threatens their well-being. Girls who marry
      before 18 are more likely to experience domestic violence and less likely to remain in school. They have worse
      economic and health outcomes than their unmarried peers, which are eventually passed down to their own children,
      further straining a country’s capacity to provide quality health and education services.</p>
    <h1 class="child-head">Migrant and displaced children:</h1>
    <p class="child-para">Millions of children are on the move. Some are driven from their homes by conflict, poverty or
      climate change. Others leave in the hope of finding a better life. Far too many encounter danger, detention,
      deprivation and discrimination on their journeys, at destination or upon return</p>
